### Project

#### `duck-duck-clone`

> [Open-Ended](http://hackyourfuture.be/homework-submission/#projects)

This week's project is to build your own accessible & responsive clone of the [DuckDuckGo home page](https://duckduckgo.com).  We don't expect your DOM to be identical to DuckDuckGo's, but the rendered site should be visually as close as possible. Unlike the last two weeks, this project does not have a video tutorial for you to follow.  You're on your own!

You will be expected to turn in your code for this project in new repo generated from [this template](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/duck-duck-clone/). It's up to you to write the development strategy!

This week you will also expected to have entirely _correct_ and _accessible_ HTML & CSS including correct Semantic HTML and ARIA. Pay special attention to points of user interaction like the search field and submit button! Your coaches will be using the validation buttons on your deployed page, FireFox's Accessibility inspector, and the accessibility audit build into Chrome Devtools to check for any mistakes.  Since these tools are also available to you, you will be able find and fix any errors on your own before submission. Any validation errors left when you submit your work will land your project in "NEEDS REVISION".

Your repository must contain:

* A README describing your project in detail.  Check out these articles to learn more about writing good README's: [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/), [bulldogjob](https://bulldogjob.com/news/449-how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-github-project), [meakaakka](https://medium.com/@meakaakka/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3)
* One well-named branch per user story. If we check out any branch, it should contain _only_ the code necessary to make that step work. and it should work!
* A file called `development-strategy.md` in which you explain how you broke the project into user stories, describe each user story, and describe what code you wrote to implement this user story.  Check out the [tomato timer code-along](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/tomato-timer-code-along/blob/master/development-strategy.md) for an example.
* Include your _wireframe_ in the `development-strategy.md` along with a little explanation of why you made it like you did.  You can either include a link if you use [wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc), or upload an image if you use another tool.
