## Prep Work

There is _a lot_ of prep work for this week, but it's doable!  Remember that the goal of prep work isn't to understand everything in depth.  It's just to be familiar so that you're not hearing about these topics for the first time on Sunday.

### Pair Programming

In class you will always be pair programming.  Take a read through [Pair Programming](https://study.hackyourfuture.be/collaborating/pair-programming) to get ready for your first coding Sunday!

### Git

This module's main objective is to learn how Git & GitHub can be used to organize your development process.  Come prepared for Sunday's activities by studying these links:

- [git & github for poets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV) - no need to go past 1.4
- [Understand how to use Atomic Commits](https://curiousprogrammer.io/blog/how-to-craft-your-changes-into-small-atomic-commits-using-git)

### User Stories

- [Agile Development by Cartoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9QbYZh1YXY&list=PLBUu5aGDLKnbeEx8U-5r436bw6p9wv1rS)
- [Splitting User Stories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDT0HMtDwYI)
- [The "what" not the "how"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=what+are+user+stories&t=brave&iax=videos&ia=videos&iai=Pn-QMvDTuEY)

### Relative vs. Absolute Paths

Not very complicated but a little tricky at first.   This will come up _all the time_, forever.

### Inspecting the DOM

- [How to inspect an element](https://www.lifewire.com/get-inspect-element-tool-for-browser-756549)
- [Modify the DOM. (does the source change?)](https://zapier.com/blog/inspect-element-tutorial/)

### HTML 5 Semantic Layout

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure)
- [w3schools 1](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_layout.asp)
- [w3schools 2](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)

## Lesson Plan

> [Lesson Plan Slides](https://hackyourfuture.be/incremental-development/week-1)

Learn how to use a `development-strategy.md` to plan your development, and git branches to organize your development

### Isolate

Build _another_ group intro repository?!  But this time you'll use branches and `development-strategy.md`

### Integrate

- All About Trees: [stepped](../integrate/all-about-trees-stepped), [separated](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/built-with-branches)
- [be-semantic](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/be-semantic) (project starter repo)

### Project

#### `acme-web-design`

> [Code-Along](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/students/weekly-assignments#projects)

This week's project is to study and reverse-engineer the __acme-web-design__ tutorial from Traversy Media.

Writing the same code as Mr. Traversy's code is not enough! You will be expected to submit your code from his tutorial in a new repository [generated](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/) from [this starter template](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/acme-web-design), cleanly organized with one branch per step.  It's up to you to write the development strategy!

You will be assessed not only on your live demo, but also on the quality of your code, the correctness of your branches, and the completeness of your repository. Your repository must contain:

- A README describing your project in detail.  Check out these articles to learn more about writing good README's: [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/), [bulldogjob](https://bulldogjob.com/news/449-how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-github-project), [meakaakka](https://medium.com/@meakaakka/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3)
- One well-named branch per user story. If we check out any branch, it should contain _only_ the code necessary to make that step work. and it should work!
- A file called `development-strategy.md` in which you explain how you broke the project into user stories, describe each user story, and describe what code you wrote to implement this user story _in detail_.

There are two general paths you can take to get this finished repo, neither is better or worse.  And if you find another way go for it!

- __Two-Stepping__: First - follow the tutorial studying the code and understanding the project.  Second - go through the tutorial another time, this time around focusing on using branches to create a finished repository.
- __One-Stepping__: Follow the tutorial once more slowly, carefully building your finished repository as you go.
