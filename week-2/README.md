## Prep Work

### CLI

- [Jesse Showalter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XgBd6rjuDQ)
- CLI games:
  - [bashcrawl](https://gitlab.com/slackermedia/bashcrawl/) - clone & play
  - [Terminus](https://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html) - online
  - [iTerm](https://sr6033.github.io/lterm/) - online
- [A huge cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/LeCoupa/122b12050f5fb267e75f)

### HTML & CSS

- [What is Responsive Design?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KGah8bW8GE)

## Lesson Plan

> [Lesson Plan Slides](https://hackyourfuture.be/incremental-development/week-2)

Incrementally develop a simple responsive web page.

### Isolate

- Practice using your computer's CLI by [replicating this folder structure](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/replicate-this-from-command-line) using only terminal commands.

### Integrate

- [be-responsive](https://github.com/hackyourfuturebelgium/be-responsive) (starter repo)
  - Create a basic HTML/CSS website that matches this layout
  - Use branches!
  - And try to do as much as you can from CLI

### Project

#### `app-theme`

> [Code-Along](http://hackyourfuture.be/homework-submission/#projects)

This week's project is to study the __app-theme__ tutorial from Traversy Media.

Writing the same code as Mr. Traversy's code is not enough!  You will be expected to submit your code from his tutorial in a new repository [generated](https://github.blog/2019-06-06-generate-new-repositories-with-repository-templates/) from [this starter template](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/acme-web-design), cleanly organized with one branch per step.  It's up to you to write the development strategy!

You will be assessed not only on your live demo, but also on the quality of your code, the correctness of your branches, and the completeness of your repository. Your repository must contain:

- A README describing your project in detail.  Check out these articles to learn more about writing good README's: [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/), [bulldogjob](https://bulldogjob.com/news/449-how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-github-project), [meakaakka](https://medium.com/@meakaakka/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3)
- One well-named branch per user story. If we check out any branch, it should contain _only_ the code necessary to make that step work. and it should work!
- A file called `development-strategy.md` in which you explain how you broke the project into user stories, describe each user story, and describe what code you wrote to implement this user story.  Check out the [tomato timer code-along](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/tomato-timer-code-along/blob/master/development-strategy.md) for an example.

There are two general paths you can take to get this finished repo, neither is better or worse.  And if you find another way go for it!

- __Two-Stepping__: First - follow the tutorial studying the code and understanding the project.  Second - go through the tutorial another time, this time around focusing on using branches to create a finished repository.
- __One-Stepping__: Follow the tutorial once more slowly, carefully building your finished repository as you go.
